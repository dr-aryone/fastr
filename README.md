Fastr is a chrome extension based on [Turbolinks.js](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)

It makes a faster user experience possible, because there are generally fewer reloads and browser refreshes.

Here's a demo of how the tech behind fastr works on [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com)

The faster reloads work only with links which have the same origin.

Here is it explained in the Turbolinks repo - 

>Get the performance benefits of a single-page application without the added complexity of a client-side JavaScript framework. Use HTML to render your views on the server side and link to pages as usual. When you follow a link, Turbolinks automatically fetches the page, swaps in its <body>, and merges its <head>, all without incurring the cost of a full page load.
